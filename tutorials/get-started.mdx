The Current Weather Data API provides access to weather data for any location worldwide.
In this tutorial, you will make your first call to the the Current Weather Data API.

<Steps titleSize="h2">
  <Step title="Create an account">
  To get started with the Current Weather Data API, you need to create a personal account.

    1. Go to https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up.
    2. Fill in the form with the required info.
    3. Click **Create account**.
    4. In the confirmation email, click **Verify your email**.\
    Without a verified email address, you won't be able to use the Current Weather Data API.

    Once your email address has been successfully confirmed, you can [sign in to your account](https://openweathermap.org/home/sign_in).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get an API key">
  When your account is created, an API key is generated. You need this API key to call the Current Weather Data API.

    1. [Sign in to your account](https://openweathermap.org/home/sign_in).
    2. In the top menu, click your name > **My API keys**.
    
    Your API key is listed under the **Key** column.

    <Info>Make sure the status of your API key is **Active**. If the status is **Inactive**, click the toggle icon to activate your API key.</Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make your first call">
  Now that you have your API key, you are ready to make your first call to the Current Weather Data API.
  
  The following example shows how to get the current weather in Paris, France, using cURL in a terminal.

    1. Open your terminal.
    2. Copy and paste the following code snippet.\
       Replace `API_KEY` with your API key from Step 2.
        ```curl
        curl --request GET \
        --url 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=48.8534&lon=2.3488&appid=API_KEY'
        ```
        The URL `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather` is the endpoint for the Current Weather Data API.\
        The `lat` and `lon` parameters specify the geographic coordinates for the location you want to retrieve weather data for. In this example, we're using the coordinates for Paris, France.\
        The `appid` parameter is where you need to provide your API key.
  
  The JSON response should look something like this:
        ```JSON
        {
            "coord": {
                "lon": 2.3488,
                "lat": 48.8534
            },
            "weather": [
                {
                    "id": 803,
                    "main": "Clouds",
                    "description": "broken clouds",
                    "icon": "04d"
                }
            ],
            "base": "stations",
            "main": {
                "temp": 289.28,
                "feels_like": 288.7,
                "temp_min": 288.21,
                "temp_max": 291.69,
                "pressure": 1022,
                "humidity": 67
            },
            "visibility": 10000,
            "wind": {
                "speed": 2.57,
                "deg": 40
            },
            "clouds": {
                "all": 75
            },
            "dt": 1717406455,
            "sys": {
                "type": 2,
                "id": 2041230,
                "country": "FR",
                "sunrise": 1717386622,
                "sunset": 1717444055
            },
            "timezone": 7200,
            "id": 2988507,
            "name": "Paris",
            "cod": 200
        }
        ```
  Let's have a look at the reponse:
      * The `coord` object includes the longitude (`lon`) and latitude (`lat`) of the location.

      * The `weather` object includes the weather parameters for the location:
    
        * `id` is the weather condition identifier. For a full list of weather conditions identifiers, see .
        * `main` corresponds to the group of weather parameters (`weather.main`).
        * `description` is the weather condition.
        * `icon` is the related weather icon . For a full list of weather icons, see .
    
      * The main object includes temperature and pressure info:
    
        * `temp` is the current Kelvin temperature.
        * `feels_like` is the perceived temperature.
        * `temp_min` and `temp_max` are the minimum and maximum temperatures at the moment, respectively.
        Both temperatures are only available for large megalopolises and urban areas.
      At the time of the API call, `289.28` is the Kelvin temperature (`main.temp`).
    
      * The `wind` object includes wind speed (`speed`) in meters/second and wind direction (`deg`) in degrees.

      * The `clouds` object shows the cloudiness percentage (`all`).

      * The `sys` object includes info about the location's country (`country`) as well as sunrise (`sunrise`) and sunset (`sunset`) times in Unix time (UTC).
